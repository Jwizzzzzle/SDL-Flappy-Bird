# SDL-FlappyBird

This is a Flappy Bird clone built with c++ and SDL2. In order to build you will need [msvc command line](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019) - its the "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019", [SDL2 for VC](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php), and [SDL2_image for VC](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/). Make a sdl directory in the main directory. Put the include folder in there and all 4 lib files. Finally place all .dll files in the main directory.
I followed the [Codergophers SDL2 RPG series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2RPjWnJduNmXHRYwdtublIPdlqocBoLS) to learn the basics of SDL2.
